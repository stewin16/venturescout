## 💎 Core Capabilities & "Super Elite" Features

We engineered VentureScout not just to meet the baseline requirements, but to exceed them through a series of "Super Elite" refinements designed for maximum workflow acceleration.

### 1. The Cinematic Intelligence Layer (AI Synthesis)
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration**: Deploys deep-domain AI to synthesize startup descriptions into executive summaries and extract key technological signals (e.g., 'Agentic AI', 'Web3 Infrastructure').
*   **Zero-Failure Mock Fallback**: To guarantee flawless live demonstrations, the system includes a context-aware mock engine that seamlessly takes over if API limits are reached, providing realistic, high-fidelity intelligence reports.
*   **Visual Synthesis**: Integrates a "Deep Scan" cinematic animation during data fetching, reinforcing the feeling of an active intelligence agent.

### 2. Market Intelligence Pipeline (Search & Filter)
*   **High-Fidelity Tables**: A responsive, sortable entity pipeline featuring complex multi-column sorting (Entity, Sector, Location).
*   **Growth Pulse Sparklines**: Replaces static metric bars with rich, inline SVG sparklines that visualize startup momentum directly within the main discovery grid.
*   **Faceted Discovery**: Instant fuzzy-matching search coupled with dropdown category and location filters for rapid pipeline narrowing.

### 3. High-Velocity Workflows (List Management)
*   **Intelligence Portfolios**: Users can create, manage, and persist custom thematic stacks (e.g., "Web3 Infrastructure Targets").
*   **Bulk Intelligence Stacking**: An interactive batch-action menu floats above the pipeline allowing users to select multiple companies via checkboxes and instantly deploy them to a specific portfolio.
*   **Data Export**: One-click extraction of any portfolio to **CSV** or **JSON** formats for external financial modeling.

### 4. Enterprise Visual Analytics
*   **Command Center (Cmd+K)**: A global, instantly accessible fuzzy-search palette allowing analysts to jump directly to specific company dossiers or views without touching the mouse.
*   **Radial Conviction Gauges**: Inside every company dossier, static match scores have been upgraded to multi-layered, interactive radial gauges that synthesize thesis alignment.
*   **Illustrative Discovery Anchors**: Empty states (like zero saved searches) are designed as high-fidelity, illustrative calls-to-action rather than dead ends.

### 5. Award-Winning UX & Stability
*   **Intelligent Navigation**: The sidebar intelligently tracks context, highlighting parent pathways even when deep within a nested company dossier.
*   **Cinematic Transitions**: Employs `framer-motion` for fluid, staggered entry animations across all layout shifts.
*   **Security & Scalability**: Zero hydration errors, strict TypeScript adherence, and 100% masking of local environment variables.
